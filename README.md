# Data-Analysis-on-wearable-sensors-using-ML-and-DL-techniques
This project involves loading, preprocessing, and training various machine learning models on activity and sensor data. The goal is to classify different activities based on sensor data using models such as Random Forest, XGBoost, RBM with Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Convolutional Denoising Autoencoders (CDAE).
