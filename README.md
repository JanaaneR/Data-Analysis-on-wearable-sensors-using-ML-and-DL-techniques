# Data-Analysis-on-wearable-sensors-using-ML-and-DL-techniques
This project involves loading, preprocessing, and training various machine learning models on activity and sensor data. The goal is to classify different activities based on sensor data using models such as Random Forest, XGBoost, RBM with Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Convolutional Denoising Autoencoders (CDAE).

## Features
-Data Loading: Activity and sensor data from Excel and CSV files.
-Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, label encoding, and SMOTE for balancing.
-Model Training:
 -Random Forest Classifier
 -XGBoost Classifier
 -BernoulliRBM with Logistic Regression
 -Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
 -Convolutional Denoising Autoencoder (CDAE)
-Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix.

## Tools and Libraries used
-Data Handling: numpy, pandas
-Preprocessing: scikit-learn, imblearn
-Model Training: xgboost, tensorflow.keras, sklearn
-Evaluation and Visualization: scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib
